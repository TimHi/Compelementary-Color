# ColoR

ColoR's main aspect is the creation of complementary color palettes. It also offers RGB to hex conversions.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    > bundle add coloR

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    > gem install coloR

## Usage

Call `ColoR.get_complementary_color(hex_color)`and pass a valid hex color.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
